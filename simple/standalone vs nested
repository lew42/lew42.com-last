If someone is able to git clone simple, and run it, we can't just set Module.base to "simple/modules".

We could, upon first Module definition, set the Module.base, based on the starting url...?
	We only need to change it when hosting the repo at /simple/ sub dir.

simple/
	gulp
	--> runs @ localhost

lew42/
	gulp
	--> imports /simple/gulpfile.js
	--> imports all other gulpfile's
	--> sets up one server

We need `reloadWatchGlobs` from each package.
We need, for /simple/, to configure Module.base = "simple/modules", somehow...

Can the lew42 gulpfile do it?  Maybe it serves...simple.js w/ an extra "Module.base = .."


How can we.. inject temporary values from node-land into the client?
How about, just adding a module?
	This would work after Module is defined

For the Module repo, we need to set a base dir?
It might not actually matter?


Also, to keep namespaces clean, why not extend Module?

simple.js
	1. in a closure, const Simple extends Module
		- this just keeps namespace clean...
	2. Simple("thing", [], ...);

This just keeps 



/simple/view/
/simple/ui/
...?

simple-base?

simple exported Base, is, and View?
All these "globals" might be handy/ needed in other "simple" files?
